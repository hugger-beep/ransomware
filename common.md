   - RDS/Aurora databases for inventory and orders
   - Back-office systems on EC2/WorkSpaces

3. **Verify AWS Backup Integrity**:
   - Confirm AWS Backup recovery points are unaffected
   - Verify S3 object versions predate the attack
   - Test sample restoration in isolated VPC
   - Check RDS automated backups for integrity

### Execution Phase
1. **Isolation Protocol**:
   - Create isolation security groups for affected instances

   - Recover RDS databases to point-in-time before attack
   - Restore S3 objects from previous versions
   - Recover DynamoDB tables from backups

4. **Staged Recovery Approach**:
   - Recover critical retail operations first (POS EC2 instances, payment processing)
   - Restore customer-facing systems (ALB, CloudFront, API Gateway)
   - Recover non-essential systems last

### Post-Recovery Actions
1. **Verification Procedures**:
   - Use AWS Systems Manager to verify system functionality
