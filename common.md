# AWS Ransomware Recovery Strategies for Retail Industry

## Common Ransomware Attack Scenarios in Retail on AWS

### 1. EC2-Hosted POS System Encryption
- **Scenario**: Malware encrypts EC2 instances running POS applications
- **Impact**: Inability to process transactions, complete sales, or access inventory data
- **AWS Services Affected**: EC2, EBS volumes, RDS databases, ElastiCache

### 2. S3-Stored Customer Data Encryption/Exfiltration
- **Scenario**: Ransomware encrypts or exfiltrates customer data stored in S3
- **Impact**: Loss of customer records, potential data breach, compliance violations
- **AWS Services Affected**: S3, DynamoDB, RDS, Aurora

### 3. RDS/Aurora Inventory Database Compromise
- **Scenario**: Ransomware targeting inventory databases in RDS/Aurora
- **Impact**: Inability to track stock, fulfill orders, or manage supply chain
- **AWS Services Affected**: RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, DocumentDB

### 4. AWS-Hosted E-commerce Platform Attack
- **Scenario**: Web applications on ECS/EKS/EC2 encrypted or defaced
- **Impact**: Loss of online sales channel, customer trust issues
- **AWS Services Affected**: EC2, ECS, EKS, S3, CloudFront, RDS

### 5. AWS Account Compromise
- **Scenario**: Attacker gains access to AWS account and deploys ransomware
- **Impact**: Widespread encryption, resource deletion, credential theft
- **AWS Services Affected**: Multiple services across the account

## Essential AWS Recovery Tools and Technologies

### AWS Backup and Recovery Services
- **AWS Backup**: Centralized backup service for EC2, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS
- **Amazon S3 Versioning**: Maintains multiple versions of objects for recovery
- **Amazon RDS Automated Backups**: Point-in-time recovery for databases
- **AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery**: Continuous replication for EC2 instances
- **Amazon EBS Snapshots**: Point-in-time copies of EBS volumes

### AWS Security and Forensic Tools
- **Amazon GuardDuty**: Threat detection service for AWS accounts and workloads
- **AWS Security Hub**: Comprehensive security and compliance center
- **Amazon Detective**: Security investigation and analysis
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Track user activity and API usage
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic capture and analysis

### AWS Isolation and Containment Tools
- **VPC Security Groups**: Instance-level firewall for network isolation
- **Network ACLs**: Subnet-level network access control
- **AWS WAF**: Web application firewall for filtering malicious traffic
- **AWS Shield**: DDoS protection service
- **AWS Firewall Manager**: Centrally configure and manage firewall rules

## AWS Recovery Playbooks and Procedures

### Pre-Recovery Assessment
1. **Identify Attack Scope**:
   - Use AWS Config to identify affected resources
   - Analyze CloudTrail logs for unauthorized actions
   - Review GuardDuty findings for malicious activity
   - Use Amazon Detective to understand the attack path

2. **Establish Recovery Priorities**:
   - POS systems on EC2/ECS
   - Customer-facing applications behind ALB/CloudFront
   - RDS/Aurora databases for inventory and orders
   - Back-office systems on EC2/WorkSpaces

3. **Verify AWS Backup Integrity**:
   - Confirm AWS Backup recovery points are unaffected
   - Verify S3 object versions predate the attack
   - Test sample restoration in isolated VPC
   - Check RDS automated backups for integrity

### Execution Phase
1. **Isolation Protocol**:
   - Create isolation security groups for affected instances
   - Update NACLs to block malicious traffic
   - Use AWS Organizations SCPs to restrict actions
   - Implement emergency IAM policies

2. **Clean Environment Preparation**:
   - Launch new VPC with clean infrastructure
   - Deploy CloudFormation templates for recovery environment
   - Use AWS Control Tower for secure multi-account setup
   - Prepare AMIs and container images for clean deployments

3. **AWS Data Restoration Process**:
   - Restore EC2 instances from AMIs or AWS Backup
   - Recover RDS databases to point-in-time before attack
   - Restore S3 objects from previous versions
   - Recover DynamoDB tables from backups

4. **Staged Recovery Approach**:
   - Recover critical retail operations first (POS EC2 instances, payment processing)
   - Restore customer-facing systems (ALB, CloudFront, API Gateway)
   - Recover non-essential systems last

### Post-Recovery Actions
1. **Verification Procedures**:
   - Use AWS Systems Manager to verify system functionality
   - Run database integrity checks on restored RDS instances
   - Verify CloudWatch alarms and metrics are normal
   - Test application functionality through canary deployments

2. **Enhanced AWS Monitoring**:
   - Deploy additional CloudWatch alarms
   - Enable advanced GuardDuty features
   - Implement AWS Config rules for security compliance
   - Set up CloudTrail Insights for anomaly detection

3. **Documentation and Lessons Learned**:
   - Document recovery timeline and AWS resources used
   - Update AWS Well-Architected security pillar implementation
   - Enhance AWS backup strategies based on experience

## Retail-Specific AWS Database Recovery Patterns

### POS Transaction Database Recovery (RDS/Aurora)
- **Pattern**: Point-in-time recovery with transaction reconciliation
- **AWS Implementation**:
  - Use RDS automated backups for point-in-time recovery
  - Apply AWS DMS to replicate transactions from backup sources
  - Implement Aurora global database for cross-region recovery
  - Use RDS Multi-AZ for high availability during recovery

### Customer Database Protection (DynamoDB/RDS)
- **Pattern**: Segmented backup strategy with encryption
- **AWS Implementation**:
  - Enable DynamoDB point-in-time recovery
  - Use AWS Backup for cross-region backup copies
  - Implement AWS KMS for encryption of sensitive data
  - Use DynamoDB global tables for multi-region resilience

### Inventory Database Recovery (Aurora/RDS)
- **Pattern**: Layered recovery with reconciliation
- **AWS Implementation**:
  - Use Aurora backtrack for quick recovery to previous state
  - Implement Aurora global database for cross-region recovery
  - Use AWS DMS to capture and replay transactions
  - Deploy read replicas for reporting during recovery

   - Use S3 Versioning with MFA Delete
   - Implement S3 Lifecycle policies for backup retention
   - Use AWS Backup Vault Lock for immutable backups

2. **AWS Access Control Measures**:
   - Implement separate IAM roles for backup administration
   - Use AWS Organizations SCPs to prevent backup deletion
   - Enable MFA for backup management actions
   - Implement cross-account backup access controls
