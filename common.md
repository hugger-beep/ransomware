## AWS Recovery Playbooks and Procedures

### Pre-Recovery Assessment
1. **Identify Attack Scope**:
   - Use AWS Config to identify affected resources
   - Analyze CloudTrail logs for unauthorized actions
   - Review GuardDuty findings for malicious activity
   - Use Amazon Detective to understand the attack path

2. **Establish Recovery Priorities**:
   - POS systems on EC2/ECS
   - Customer-facing applications behind ALB/CloudFront
   - RDS/Aurora databases for inventory and orders
   - Back-office systems on EC2/WorkSpaces

3. **Verify AWS Backup Integrity**:
   - Confirm AWS Backup recovery points are unaffected
   - Verify S3 object versions predate the attack
   - Test sample restoration in isolated VPC
   - Check RDS automated backups for integrity

### Execution Phase
1. **Isolation Protocol**:
   - Create isolation security groups for affected instances
   - Update NACLs to block malicious traffic
   - Use AWS Organizations SCPs to restrict actions
   - Implement emergency IAM policies

2. **Clean Environment Preparation**:
   - Launch new VPC with clean infrastructure
   - Deploy CloudFormation templates for recovery environment
   - Use AWS Control Tower for secure multi-account setup
   - Prepare AMIs and container images for clean deployments

3. **AWS Data Restoration Process**:
   - Restore EC2 instances from AMIs or AWS Backup
   - Recover RDS databases to point-in-time before attack
   - Restore S3 objects from previous versions
   - Recover DynamoDB tables from backups

4. **Staged Recovery Approach**:
   - Recover critical retail operations first (POS EC2 instances, payment processing)
   - Restore customer-facing systems (ALB, CloudFront, API Gateway)
   - Recover non-essential systems last

### Post-Recovery Actions
1. **Verification Procedures**:
   - Use AWS Systems Manager to verify system functionality
   - Run database integrity checks on restored RDS instances
   - Verify CloudWatch alarms and metrics are normal
   - Test application functionality through canary deployments

2. **Enhanced AWS Monitoring**:
   - Deploy additional CloudWatch alarms
   - Enable advanced GuardDuty features
   - Implement AWS Config rules for security compliance
   - Set up CloudTrail Insights for anomaly detection

3. **Documentation and Lessons Learned**:
   - Document recovery timeline and AWS resources used
   - Update AWS Well-Architected security pillar implementation
   - Enhance AWS backup strategies based on experience

    end
```

#### Backup Strategy Implementation Options

1. **Option 1: Single Backup Plan with Multiple Copy Targets**
   - Create one backup plan in the production account
   - Configure both cross-account and cross-region copy targets in the same plan
   - Advantages: Simpler management, single point of configuration
   - Disadvantages: Less granular control over secondary copies

2. **Option 2: Separate Backup Plans**
   - Create a primary backup plan in the production account
   - Create a secondary backup plan in the backup account to copy to other regions
   - Advantages: More control over secondary copies, separate retention policies
   - Disadvantages: More complex management, requires coordination between plans

3. **Option 3: Service-Specific Backup Approaches**
   - Use service-native replication mechanisms alongside AWS Backup
   - Examples:
     - DynamoDB: Global Tables for multi-region replication
     - S3: Cross-Region Replication with replication rules
     - RDS: Cross-Region Read Replicas with promotion capability
   - Advantages: Leverages service-specific features, may offer faster recovery
   - Disadvantages: Less centralized management, inconsistent approach across services

#### DynamoDB Backup Options

1. **AWS Backup for DynamoDB**
   - Integrated with centralized AWS Backup service
   - Supports cross-account and cross-region copies
   - Can be protected with AWS Backup Vault Lock
   - Supports scheduled backups with flexible retention

2. **DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**
   - Continuous backups with 35-day retention window
   - Restore to any point in time within the retention period
   - Protects against accidental writes or deletes
   - No additional cost for storage (pay only for restored capacity)

3. **DynamoDB On-Demand Backups**
   - Manual snapshots with indefinite retention
   - Full table backups that don't affect performance
   - Can be copied across regions and accounts
   - Useful for long-term archival needs

4. **DynamoDB Global Tables**
   - Active-active replication across multiple regions
   - Near real-time replication of data
   - Provides both disaster recovery and high availability
   - Can be used as part of a ransomware recovery strategy

#### Best Practices for Multi-Region, Multi-Account Backups

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Use multiple backup mechanisms for critical data
   - Combine AWS Backup with service-specific features
   - Implement both scheduled backups and continuous replication

2. **Immutability Controls**
   - Apply Vault Lock in the cross-region backup account
   - Use SCPs to prevent backup deletion in the backup account
   - Implement strict IAM permissions for backup access

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Regularly test restoration from cross-region backups
   - Validate data integrity after restoration
   - Practice recovery scenarios using backup copies

### Complementary RDS Backup Strategies

Using both RDS automated backups and AWS Backup provides a comprehensive defense-in-depth approach:

1. **RDS Automated Backups**:
   - Provide point-in-time recovery (PITR) for up to 35 days
   - Enable transaction log backups for continuous recovery points
   - Allow restoration to any second within the retention period
   - Are automatically enabled by default on RDS instances
   - Support automated backup windows to minimize performance impact

2. **AWS Backup for RDS**:
   - Creates additional snapshot-based backups
   - Enables longer retention periods (months to years)
   - Facilitates cross-account and cross-region copies
   - Can be protected with AWS Backup Vault Lock for immutability
   - Centralizes backup management across multiple services
   - Supports lifecycle policies for cost optimization

3. **Benefits of Dual Approach**:
   - **Defense in Depth**: Two separate backup mechanisms provide redundancy
   - **Recovery Flexibility**: PITR for granular recovery, snapshots for stable recovery points
   - **Comprehensive Protection**: Short-term operational recovery + long-term compliance needs
   - **Centralized Management**: Single dashboard for all backup types
   - **Ransomware Resilience**: Multiple recovery options if one backup type is compromised

4. **Implementation Best Practices**:
   - Configure RDS with 1-35 day retention for operational recovery
   - Use AWS Backup for weekly full snapshots with longer retention
   - Store AWS Backup copies in a separate account with Vault Lock
   - Test both recovery methods regularly as part of DR exercises
   - Implement automated validation of both backup typeslement least privilege access for backup systems

3. **AWS Backup Verification**:
   - Use AWS Lambda for automated backup testing
   - Implement AWS Config rules to verify backup compliance
   - Deploy CloudWatch alarms for backup job failures
   - Use AWS Systems Manager to automate backup verification

### AWS Backup Monitoring and Alerting
1. **Change Rate Monitoring**:
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for unusual backup size changes
   - Monitor S3 object change rates with CloudTrail
   - Track EBS snapshot creation patterns

2. **Backup Success Verification**:
   - Use AWS Step Functions for backup verification workflows
   - Implement Lambda functions for automated backup testing
   - Deploy CloudWatch dashboards for backup status monitoring

3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Use CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual backup activity
   - Implement GuardDuty for threat detection
   - Set up CloudWatch anomaly detection for backup patterns
